    abstract = "This paper introduces DAN+, a new multi-domain corpus and annotation guidelines for Dan-ish nested named entities (NEs) and lexical normalization to support research on cross-lingualcross-domain learning for a less-resourced language. We empirically assess three strategies tomodel the two-layer Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. We compare transfer capabilitiesfrom German versus in-language annotation from scratch. We examine language-specific versusmultilingual BERT, and study the effect of lexical normalization on NER. Our results show that 1) the most robust strategy is multi-task learning which is rivaled by multi-label decoding, 2) BERT-based NER models are sensitive to domain shifts, and 3) in-language BERT and lexicalnormalization are the most beneficial on the least canonical data. Our results also show that anout-of-domain setup remains challenging, while performance on news plateaus quickly. Thishighlights the importance of cross-domain evaluation of cross-lingual transfer.",
